TODO on the 313-dev branch:

- migrate (scheme r5rs) libraries up to (scheme), per r7rs
- delete the temporary (scheme r5rs) libs after suitable r7rs versions are created
- consider creating r7rs primitiveBindings in core, to minimize exported bindings
  file-exists, delete would be good choices to reorganize, there should be others as well
- need to rename some functions in base (inexact, exact???)
- it would be nice to have an empty top-level environment in r7rs mode, but it might
  not be practical at this time
- what else?
- remember to delete this file before merging back to master
