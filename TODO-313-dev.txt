TODO on the 313-dev branch:

- review each library, there are missing functions and functions exposed at top level
  (and possibly base) that should not be - such as load, read, write, eval, etc

- consider creating r7rs primitiveBindings in core, to minimize exported bindings
  file-exists, delete would be good choices to reorganize, there should be others as well
- need to rename some functions in base (inexact, exact???)
- it would be nice to have an empty top-level environment in r7rs mode, but it might
  not be practical at this time
- what else?
- remember to delete this file before merging back to master
- hang on import of (scheme r5rs) in r7rs mode
