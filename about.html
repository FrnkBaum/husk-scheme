        <p>
            husk scheme is developed by <a href="http://github.com/justinethier">Justin Ethier</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The original goal of the husk project was to teach myself Scheme, Haskell, and functional programming by going though Jonathan Tang's excellent tutorial, <a href="http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Write_Yourself_a_Scheme_in_48_Hours">Write Yourself a Scheme in 48 Hours</a>. Ultimately this project went far beyond the content in Jonathan's tutorial, and implemented a (mostly) fully-functional Scheme interpreter and macro subsystem. At its core, husk is still a learning project, although my hope is that over time it may become more than just a toy Scheme. On the one hand it has the potential to be useful for real-world applications by providing R<5>RS compatibility and an FFI to Haskell libraries. But on the other, Haskell is a great language in its own right, and husk is unlikely to approach the speed of native C implementations such as Chicken. That said, I hope people will be interested to experiment and play around with husk as it continues to improve.
