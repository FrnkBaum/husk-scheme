      <p>
        Vectors are heterogenous structures whose elements are indexed by integers. A vector typically occupies less space than a list of the same length, and the average time required to access a randomly chosen element is typically less for the vector than for the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        The length of a vector is the number of elements that it contains. This number is a non-negative integer that is fixed when the vector is created. The valid indexes of a vector are the exact non-negative integers less than the length of the vector. The first element in a vector is indexed by zero, and the last element is indexed by one less than the length of the vector.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vectors are written using the notation #(obj ...). For example, a vector of length 3 containing the number zero in element 0, the list (2 2 2 2) in element 1, and the string "Anna" in element 2 can be written as following:

{% highlight scheme %}
#(0 (2 2 2 2) "Anna")
{% endhighlight %}

Note that unlike standard R<sup>5</sup>RS, husk does not require that vector constants be quoted.
