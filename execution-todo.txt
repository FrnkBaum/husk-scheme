Some design notes regarding TCO:


Important notes from http://paulbarry.com/articles/2009/09/02/infinite-recursion

TCO isn't just about self-calling. I think the following is expected to run forever in scheme (forgive my poor scheme) but has no equivalent in Clojure, hence Clojure doesn't really have TCO (which it freely admits).

(define (foo) (bar))
(define (bar) (foo))
(foo)
