# {{ page.title }}

This release introduces an experimental compiler, `huskc`. Several examples are included in the source tree under `tests/compiler` - although for now `huskc` is mostly just a proof-of-concept. For more information see [Issue #62](https://github.com/justinethier/husk-scheme/issues/62).


Also, the cabal file has been streamlined so each source file is only compiled a single time during installation.
