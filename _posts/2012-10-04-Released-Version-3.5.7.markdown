# {{ page.title }}

This release adds support for explicit renaming macros. This low-level macro system provides the ability to break macro hygiene, if necessary, and offers a macro system that is similar to `defmacro`.

In addition, all of the character functions from R<sup>5</sup>RS have been implemented.
