TODO list for changes on this branch:

vector
 - vector-fill! should be able to be a library
   function, not a macro. put together an initial
   version but it fails both test cases
consider the following case, with or without the commented lines.
this seems to be the root problem
; ((lambda ()
  (define vec (vector 0 1 2 3 4))
  (vector-fill! vec 5)
  (write vec)
;  ))
 - may be edge cases to consider, such as 
   a vector passed directly to vector-set!
