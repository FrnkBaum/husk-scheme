      <p>
        The standard boolean objects for true and false are written as #t and #f. What really matters, though, are the objects that the Scheme conditional expressions (if, cond, and, or, do) treat as true or false. The phrase ``a true value'' (or sometimes just ``true'') means any object treated as true by the conditional expressions, and the phrase ``a false value'' (or ``false'') means any object treated as false by the conditional expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of all the standard Scheme values, only #f counts as false in conditional expressions. Except for #f, all standard Scheme values, including #t, pairs, the empty list, symbols, numbers, strings, vectors, and procedures, count as true.
      <p>
        Note:   Programmers accustomed to other dialects of Lisp should be aware that Scheme distinguishes both #f and the empty list from the symbol nil.
     </p>
     <p>
        Boolean constants evaluate to themselves, so they do not need to be quoted in programs.
