Analysis for implementing nary macros

checkLoad
---------
TBD: what about input to loadLocal? Do we keep as a list or cast to a dotted list? Keep in mind that CSI remembers whether the original input is a list or pair, and transforms appropriately.

loadLocal
---------
This function needs to be extended to handle loading of an nary macro:
loadLocal outerEnv localEnv identifiers pattern input hasEllipsis outerHasEllipsis = do

Basically for a dotted list we:
- match all elements of ps with the first elements of is (of the same length as is)
- match remaining elements of is (and i) against p. This match needs to set a variable such as hasEllipsis (or a new one) to indicate that an atom in the pattern will be loaded up as a variable to unload during transformation


transform
---------
TBD
